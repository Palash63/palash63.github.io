Hi, My name is Palash Sharma. I am so glad you've made it to my page.

I am originally from Chittagong, Bangladesh. I have my bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I came to the USA in 2015 to pursue my master's degree at the University of Nevada, Reno: Department of Mathematics and Statistics. I completed my master’s degree in Mathematics (Concentration in Statistics) in 2017 and moved to Kansas City, KS to pursue my Ph.D. journey in Biostatistics & Data Science at The University of Kansas Medical center. I have been fortunate to be a research assistant at the Department of Biostatistics & Data Science.


I have broad scientific interests in both mathematics and statistics. This ranges from exploratory data analysis to statistical modeling and draws an inference from the data. My primary research focuses on various aspects of biostatistical methodology development and application in clinical trial design and interim monitoring of time to event data using a stochastic curtailment procedure. Depending on the situation, I tend to adopt either a Bayesian or frequentist methodology to solve problems. I also have a healthy bit of interest in Statistical genetics especially Gene regulatory network modeling and Machine learning. 


I worked on designing a single-arm clinical trial design using Weibull distribution with a time-to-event endpoint borrowing information from historical controls. Also, I have worked on several projects using Linear and Non-linear mixed models with some cool people from the Neurology department. My research assistantship allows me to collaborate work on Alzheimer's disease. I worked on mitochondrial SNP based network modeling utilizing KUADC and Alzheimer’s disease neurodegenerative initiative (ADNI) data. My dissertation research involves interim monitoring of futility analysis for the time to event data in the context of a relative time framework. 


I am always up for questions about anything to do with R/SAS and statistics. I was fortunate to have some kind people show me the ways of R/SAS and statistics, and I want to help people in the same way. While I am not coding or studying, I am usually watching TV series, taking pictures, or traveling across the USA! I love traveling and would like to explore new things and get a fresh perspective through my lenses.
