Hi, My name is Palash Sharma. I am so glad you've made it to my page.


I am originally from Chittagong, Bangladesh. I came to the USA in 2015 to pursue my master's degree at the University of Nevada, Reno: Department of Mathematics and Statistics. I completed my master’s degree in 2017 and moved to Kansas City, KS to pursue my Ph.D. journey in Biostatistics & Data Science at The University of Kansas Medical center. I have been fortunate to be a research assistant at the Department of Biostatistics & Data Science.


I have broad scientific interests in both mathematics and statistics. My primary research focuses on various aspects of biostatistical methodology development and application in clinical trial design and monitoring using stochastic curtailment procedure. I also have a healthy bit of interest in Statistical genetics especially Gene network modeling and Machine learning. 


I have researched designing a single-arm clinical trial design using Weibull distribution with a time-to-event endpoint. Also, I have worked on several projects using Linear and Non-linear mixed model and mitochondrial SNP based network modeling utilizing KUADC and Alzheimer’s disease neurodegenerative initiative (ADNI) data. I also have a collaborative experience with the Neurology department.


While I am not coding or studying, I am usually watching TV series, taking pictures, or traveling across the USA! I love traveling and would like to explore new things and get a fresh perspective through my lenses.
