Hi, My name is Palash Sharma.I am so glad you've made it to my page.

I am originally from Chittagong, Bangladesh. I moved to USA in 2015 to pursue my master's at University of Nevada,Reno. I completed my Master's degree in 2017 and moved in Kansas to pursue my PhD in Biostatistics at University of Kansas Medical center. I have been fortunate 
to be a research assistant at the Deparatment of Biostatistics & Data Science department.

My research focues on various aspects of statistical methods. I have done research on designing signle arm clinical trial with time-to-event outcome. Also, I worked on mixed model and RNA sequencing based on ADNI data.

While I am not coding or studying, I am usually watching TV series, taking pictures!
