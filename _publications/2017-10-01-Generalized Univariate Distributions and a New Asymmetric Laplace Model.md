This work provides a survey of the general class of distributions generated from the mixture of the beta random variables. We provide an extensive review of the literature, concerning generating new distributions via the inverse CDF transformation. In particular, we accounted for beta generated and Kumaraswamy generated families of distributions. We provide a brief summary of each of their families of distributions. We also propose a new asymmetric mixture distribution, which is an alternative to beta generated distributions. We provide basic properties of this new class of distributions generated from the Laplace model. We also address the issue of parameter estimation of this new skew generalized Laplace model.
