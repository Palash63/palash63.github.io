Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is associated with insulin resistance and low cardiorespiratory fitness, suggestive of impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. We examined if individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the earliest phase of AD-related cognitive decline, exhibit reduced skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and if AD medication impacted outcomes.
